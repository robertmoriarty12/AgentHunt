# AiHunt Logic App

This Logic App automates weekly hunting for **Solorigate pipe activity** using Microsoft Security Copilot and delivers summarized findings by email.

---

## üìå Overview

The workflow is designed to:
1. Run on a weekly schedule.
2. Trigger a hunting query against Security Copilot for Solorigate pipe detection.
3. Evaluate whether the results are *interesting*.
4. If relevant, build a concise HTML report.
5. Send the report by email to a configured recipient.

This enables continuous automated hunting with **AI-driven triage** and **actionable reporting**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Steps

1. **Recurrence Trigger**  
   Runs every week (configurable in the Logic App definition).

2. **Hunt Solorigate Pipe**  
   Calls Security Copilot with the plugin `AgentHuntSolorigatePipeDetection` to search for Solorigate-related indicators.

3. **Determine Interest**  
   Uses Copilot reasoning (`/askgpt`) to classify findings.  
   - Responds **"yes"** if interesting.  
   - Responds **"no"** if not.

4. **Is Interesting (Condition)**  
   - If **No** ‚Üí The workflow ends.  
   - If **Yes** ‚Üí Proceeds to reporting.

5. **Build Report**  
   Generates an **HTML summary** of the findings for email delivery.

6. **Send an Email**  
   Sends the weekly hunting report to the configured `notificationEmail` recipient via Office 365.
